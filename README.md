# Heart-disease-prediction

The goal of this project is to develop classifiers for heart disease prediction based on the data collected in the United States by the Centers for 
DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC). The dataset used has the title ’Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease’ and is available, with more information, at: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease. The data used can also be found in this repository as 
heart_2020_cleaned.csv and all_data.mat - they are exaclty the same. 

This project analyses three different scenarios. In scenario A, all the interviewed people were divided in two classes: either having coronary heart 
disease or not. In scenario B the people were divided again into two classes: having coronary heart disease (either coronary heart disease or myocardial 
infarction) or not having any heart disease. Finally, in scenario C the people were divided into three classes: having heart disease with comorbidities, 
having heart disease without comorbidities, or not having heart disease (with or without comorbidities).
